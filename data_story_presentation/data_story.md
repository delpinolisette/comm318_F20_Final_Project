# Introduction
1.	The onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the united states led to a disastrous level of unemployment in the United States. 
    - A particularly disastrous end for service-based companies and their employees. To this day, there is no easy fix to this, since social distancing is crucial to the stop of the spread of the virus. 
2.	Why investigate this?
    - As someone who has worked in service roles in the past, remembering how many of my coworkers had families to support, this makes me especially worried. 
    - As a college student currently searching for post-graduation employment, I am also concerned about the state of the economy. 
    - But I am more so concerned about a sense of general despair in the American population. Services (including financial services) make up 68% of the US Economy TODO CITE, 
    - While that number encompasses the most affected industries, including food and all kinds of services, it’s indicative of how service based the US is. 
3.	Where to source the data from?
    - I sourced it from popular job seeking and advice forums on reddit for several reasons. 
        - It is free to make an account on Reddit – anyone can go to it seeking for advice. 
        - Reddit is home to just under 30 million American users, I am focused on the American economic impact with this data story. 
    - In particular, I chose two popular subreddits – R/Jobs and R/CareerGuidance. These are field agnostic, and in the future, I would like to do a similar analysis on tech career subreddits. 
# Analysis
1.	Did activity go up on these subreddits after the onset of the Covid 19 Lockdown? I investigated:

    - I scraped the top 1000 posts of all time (most votes and comments) and found interesting patterns: 

    - For r/careerguidance, after sub setting by month, we found that:
         - For April something interesting happened. People started having anxiety regarding quitting or losing their jobs during the pandemic. It became an economic threat as well as a health threat. 
         - From the data we find that the highest ranking post in April in r/careerguidance was:
           - j
