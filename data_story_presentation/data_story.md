# Economic Changes and Frustrations in the US during the Coronavirus Pandemic
## A Story in Reddit Posts

# Introduction and Motivation
1.	The onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States led to a disastrous level of unemployment in the United States. 
    - A particularly disastrous end for service-based companies and their employees. To this day, there is no easy fix to this, since social distancing is crucial to the stop of the spread of the virus. 
2.	Why investigate this?
    - As someone who has worked in service roles in the past, remembering how many of my coworkers had families to support, this makes me especially worried. 
      - In some states, unemployment websites were broken, and several family friends had no way to even apply for unemployment (Florida). TODO CITE
      - This unemployment benefit uncertainty is not only an economic strain but a mental health strain on those trying to make ends meet for their families. 
    - person motivation: As a college student currently searching for post-graduation employment, I am also concerned about the state of the economy. 
    - But I am more so concerned about a sense of general despair in the American population. Services (including financial services) make up 68% of the US Economy TODO CITE, 
    - While that number encompasses the most affected industries, including food and all kinds of services, it’s indicative of how service based the US is. 
3.	Where to source the data from?
    - I sourced it from popular job seeking and advice forums on reddit for several reasons. 
        - It is free to make an account on Reddit – anyone can go to it seeking for advice. 
        - Reddit is home to just under 30 million American users, I am focused on the American economic impact with this data story. 
    - In particular, I chose two popular subreddits – R/Jobs and R/CareerGuidance. These are field agnostic, and in the future, I would like to do a similar analysis on tech career subreddits. 
# Analysis
1.	Did activity go up on these subreddits after the onset of the Covid 19 Lockdown? I investigated (spolier: it did, a bit, in CareerGuidance)
    - The data can be found in data/raw folder. 
    - I scraped the top 1000 posts of all time (most votes and comments) and found interesting patterns: 

    - For r/careerguidance, after sub setting by month, we found that:
         - For April something interesting happened. People started having anxiety regarding quitting or losing their jobs during the pandemic. It became an economic threat as well as a health threat. 
         - From the data we find that the highest ranking post in April in r/careerguidance was:
           - directly related to losing your job during the coronavirus pandemic:QUOTED HERE
           -  > Are you seriously trying to quit your job during a global pandemic and impending recession? o_O
           -  >  Advice This will probably be downvoted to hell. That’s okay. But really, there has been an uptick in people posting about quitting their jobs. This isn’t to berate you. If you aren’t happy, you really should find a way to leave. ...Where I am, the depression from the lockdown retrenchments alone has led to a rise in suicides. Quitting your job and then finding yourself in the cold may put you in a worse off position. This is sounding harsh but it is coming from a good place. Things are going to work out. We just don’t know when. In the meantime, hang in there. Take this global lockdown time to plan your exit meticulously, save up and start skilling up for the jump. Good luck!
           -  We can see tension is rising regarding job security amidst the pandemic. It had the highest number of upvotes, meaning users upvoted this post more than any other post made in April in 2020. 
           -  In contrast, the post with the highest number of comments from r/careerguidance from March 2020 (too soon for the full extent of masssive layoffs, furloughed employees, rescinded job offers) was concered with being rejected from a job despite being qualified:
           -  >  I was rejected from a position that required a high school diploma when I have a bachelor's. How am I supposed to properly handle how pathetic I feel right now?
           -  


1. What were the most popular types of posts before th onset of the pandemic? Which were the most popular types of posts after the onset?
    - INSERT TOP 5 SCORES FROM COVID DF FOR RJOBS VS TOP 5 SCORED FROM NON COVID DF FOR R JOBS
    - HIGHLIGHT THE TOP 5 POSTS FROM EACH in bar plot
    - From this, you can see that the focus started to shift onto digital job tools (LinkedIn, Glassdoor) and feelings regarding those tools.  
    - During this time, we also see a rise in users complaining about not being able to find work, despite their best efforts:

| Is there no place for employees that are just pretty good at their jobs?   | Text  | |
| How do I get over my deep-seated dislike of working?| |

# Summary + Possible Limitations of My Analysis

1. One social media site is not a faithful representation of the entire country, but drastic changes online might signal drastic changes in the US economic landscape.
